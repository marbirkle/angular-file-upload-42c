  - Defines build settings
  - Sets up routing for SPA
  - Configures security headers
  - Sets cache policies for assets

- **.vercelignore**: Files to exclude from deployment
  - Reduces deployment size
  - Speeds up build process

### Production Build

To test the production build locally:

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# The output will be in dist/apps/file-upload/browser
```
